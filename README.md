# Agricultural Commodities Consulting Firm Simulation

This project simulates the complex and evolving landscape of an agricultural commodities consulting firm. It models various internal and external factors influencing the industry, from climate change and geopolitical events to shifts in client needs and the consulting marketplace itself. The simulation aims to provide insights into strategic decision-making for such a firm.

## Project Overview

The simulation is built around several core modules, each representing a key aspect of the agricultural commodities consulting world:

*   **Industry Transformation Landscape**: Models external pressures like climate change impacts on yield, geopolitical disruptions to supply chains, input cost dynamics, and trade flow reconfigurations.
*   **Value Chain Reconfiguration**: Explores changes within the agricultural value chain, including production system transformations, shifts in end-user demand, evolution in processing and handling, and new trading/risk management approaches.
*   **Consulting Marketplace Evolution**: Simulates the changing dynamics of the consulting market itself, such as evolving client needs, shifts in service portfolios, a reshaping competitive landscape, and new talent requirements.
*   **Operational Model Innovation**: Focuses on the internal adaptations a consulting firm might undertake, including delivery model transformation, go-to-market strategy, knowledge/IP development, and organizational structure optimization.
*   **Strategic Scenarios & Decision Frameworks**: Provides tools and models for strategic planning, including scenario analysis for industry divergence, client type evolution, consulting industry disruption, investment prioritization, and risk management.
*   **Specialized Opportunities**: Dives into specific high-growth service areas like digital agriculture implementation, sustainability transformation, climate impact assessment, and trade/market access strategy.
*   **Implementation Roadmap**: Outlines a phased approach to implementing strategic changes within a consulting firm.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories corresponding to these core modules. Each directory contains Python files that implement specific sub-models and simulations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   (No external libraries are strictly required by the current models beyond standard Python libraries, but this might change if more complex data analysis or visualization is added.)

### Running the Simulation

To run the full suite of simulations and generate an HTML report:

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deluair/Agricultural-Commodities-Consulting.git
    cd Agricultural-Commodities-Consulting
    ```

2.  **Ensure Python is installed and accessible in your PATH.**

3.  **Run the main simulation script from the root directory of the project:**
    ```bash
    python run_simulation.py
    ```

4.  **Output:**
    *   The script will print status messages to the console as it executes each module's simulation.
    *   Upon completion, an HTML report named `simulation_report.html` will be generated in the root directory. This report contains a formatted summary of the outputs from each simulation module.
    *   The console will also indicate the path to this report.

## Simulation Logic

Each Python module (`*.py` file) typically defines one or more classes representing specific models or concepts (e.g., `ClimateShockYieldVolatility`, `FarmConsolidationTrends`). These classes contain methods to simulate scenarios, analyze data, or project trends based on a set of predefined parameters, assumptions, and simplified data structures (often Python dictionaries).

The `run_simulation.py` script orchestrates the execution:
1.  It imports the main orchestrating classes from most of the key modules.
2.  For each imported class, it instantiates an object.
3.  It then calls specific methods on these objects, mirroring the example scenarios often found in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks of the individual module files.
4.  The print outputs generated during these method calls are captured.
5.  Finally, these captured outputs are compiled into the `simulation_report.html` file for easier review.

## Key Files

*   **`run_simulation.py`**: The main executable script to run all simulations.
*   **`simulation_report.html`**: The auto-generated HTML report summarizing simulation outputs.
*   **`agricultural-commodities-consulting-simulation.md`**: The original detailed design document outlining the scope and intent of the various simulation components.
*   **Module Directories (e.g., `industry_transformation_landscape/`)**: Contain the Python code for the individual simulation models.

## Contributing

(Placeholder for contribution guidelines if this were an open project - e.g., how to propose new models, report issues, or suggest improvements.)

## Future Development Ideas

*   Integration of real-world datasets via APIs or local data files.
*   More sophisticated modeling techniques (e.g., statistical models, machine learning for predictions).
*   Interactive dashboards for visualizing simulation results (e.g., using Dash/Plotly or Streamlit).
*   Expansion of placeholder models with more detailed logic and parameters.
*   Development of a configuration system to easily adjust simulation parameters.
