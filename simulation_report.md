# Agricultural Commodities Consulting Simulation - Execution Summary

This report summarizes the simulated execution of the main example scenarios defined within each of the primary Python modules of the Agricultural Commodities Consulting simulation.

## I. Industry Transformation Landscape

This section explores broad industry-level shifts and their impacts.

### 1. `climate_shock_yield_volatility.py`

**Simulated Execution:**
The main execution block of this module would typically:
1.  Instantiate the `ClimateShockYieldVolatility` orchestrator class, providing baseline data for regions, crops, and yields.
2.  Define parameters for one or more specific shock scenarios (e.g., a regional drought, a widespread heatwave, general climate change impacts) to be used with the `simulate_yield_shock_scenarios` method. This method internally calls sub-models for `ClimateVolatilityModel`, `ExtremeTemperatureImpact`, `DroughtImpactAssessment`, and `FloodImpactAssessment`.
3.  Define a timeline of multiple shock events for a specific region and crop to be used with the `analyze_regional_impact_multi_shock` method.
4.  Optionally, call `model_volatility_propagation` to conceptually trace how an initial shock might spread.
5.  Print detailed results for each simulation, including:
    *   Scenario parameters.
    *   Breakdown of yield impacts from different perils (general trends, drought, heatwave, flood, frost).
    *   Total estimated yield impact percentage.
    *   Projected yield in tonnes/ha based on a baseline.
    *   Notes from the `YieldShockPropagation` sub-model regarding supply chain impacts.
    *   For multi-shock scenarios, a timeline of impacts and the final projected yield.

*(Note: The exact `if __name__ == '__main__':` block could not be fully read due to tool limitations, so this summary is based on the available class structure and typical usage patterns observed in other modules.)*

### 2. `geopolitical_disruption_supply_chain.py`

**Simulated Execution:**
The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block performs the following:
1.  Initializes the `GeopoliticalDisruptionSupplyChain` orchestrator with sample initial data (e.g., global wheat trade volume).
2.  **Chokepoint Disruption:** Simulates a "Blockage" at the "Suez Canal" for 2 weeks, affecting "grains" and "oilseeds". The output details the chokepoint, scenario, duration, commodities at risk, estimated trade value disrupted, potential impacts (e.g., re-routing costs, price volatility), and mitigation considerations.
3.  **Conflict Impact:** Simulates a "High" intensity conflict in the "Ukraine/Black Sea Region" for 6 months, affecting "wheat", "corn", and "sunflower oil". The output describes the region, conflict parameters, key affected commodities, potential production loss percentage, export reduction percentage, price impacts, and food security implications for dependent regions.
4.  **Trade Policy Impact:** Simulates an "export_ban" on "wheat" by "Major Exporter X" for 3 months. The output includes the policy details, affected commodity, potential market impact (price changes, trade flow redirection), and an assessment of market response strategies (e.g., sourcing alternatives, policy advocacy).
5.  **Risk Index Update:** Calculates and prints an overall geopolitical risk index based on the preceding scenarios. This includes scores for chokepoint, conflict, and trade policy components, and an overall index value with a timestamp.
6.  **Supply Chain Diversification Analysis:**
    *   For "wheat" (risk threshold 'Medium'): Provides recommendations like identifying alternative suppliers, investing in storage, and exploring different trade routes.
    *   For "corn" (default risk threshold): Similar analysis and recommendations tailored to corn.

### 3. `input_cost_dynamics_margin_structure.py`

**Simulated Execution:**
The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block executes a multi-section simulation:
1.  **Fertilizer Cost Analysis:**
    *   Calculates and prints baseline fertilizer costs/ha for wheat (e.g., $X/ha) and corn (e.g., $Y/ha).
    *   Simulates a +20% Urea price increase, printing the new wheat fertilizer cost/ha and the change in cost.
2.  **Energy Cost Analysis:**
    *   Calculates and prints baseline direct energy cost for a 100ha Midwest Grain Farm (e.g., $Z total).
    *   Simulates a +25% diesel and +10% electricity price increase, printing the new total energy cost and the change.
3.  **Labour Cost Analysis:**
    *   Calculates and prints baseline labor cost/ha for US average grain farming (e.g., $A/ha).
    *   Simulates a +15% field worker wage increase, printing the new labor cost/ha.
    *   Estimates H2A labor costs for 10 workers in CA for 6 months (e.g., $B total).
4.  **Agri-Input Price Index:**
    *   Prints an initial Agri-Input Price Index (e.g., 100 for baseline year 2024).
    *   Updates the fertilizer component to an index of 115 and fuel to 125.
    *   Prints the new overall index (e.g., 112.5) and the current indexed prices of components.
5.  **Farm Margin Model & Sensitivity Analysis (Wheat Example):**
    *   Sets up a generic wheat farm scenario (yield: 5 t/ha, price: $220/t, specific variable/fixed costs). Prints the base net margin (e.g., $C/ha).
    *   Prints sensitivity results for:
        *   +10% Fertilizer Cost: New net margin and change in margin.
        *   -15% Fuel Cost: New net margin and change in margin.
        *   +8% Market Price: New net margin and change in margin.
6.  **Combined Input Cost Scenario (Corn Example):**
    *   The orchestrator internally sets up a corn farm scenario.
    *   Simulates a combined shock: +15% fertilizer cost impact, +20% diesel impact, +10% labor cost impact, and -5% corn price.
    *   Prints a summary including base net margin, new net margin, and change for this corn scenario.

### 4. `trade_flow_reconfiguration_market_access.py`

**Simulated Execution:**
The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates several functionalities:
1.  **Market Access Analysis (Corn - US to China):**
    *   Analyzes tariffs (e.g., MFN, TRQ rates, landed cost impact), SPS compliance (e.g., pesticide residue check), TBT compliance (e.g., labeling), and Rules of Origin (e.g., USMCA context if product transshipped, though less direct for US-China).
    *   Prints a detailed breakdown of each aspect and a summary.
2.  **New Trade Barrier (SPS on Beef to EU):**
    *   Simulates a new SPS measure on beef imports to the EU due to a disease concern.
    *   Prints the scenario, trigger, barrier details, vulnerability score used, and potential impacts (e.g., complexity factor, compliance cost increase).
    *   Assesses and prints the escalation risk (e.g., probability, possible retaliation).
3.  **Trade Agreement Impact:**
    *   Analyzes CPTPP's impact on dairy trade from New Zealand to Canada (e.g., tariff reduction, RoO, SPS considerations).
    *   Compares CPTPP vs. RCEP for wheat trade from Australia to Indonesia, highlighting differences in benefits or requirements.
4.  **Bilateral Relationship Scenario (US-China Negative):**
    *   Models the impact of increased US-China tensions (e.g., new agri tariffs).
    *   Prints affected commodities, a summary of potential impacts (e.g., trade decrease, price hikes), and an estimated impact score.
5.  **Trade Flow Volatility (Soybeans - US to China Tariff Shock):**
    *   Simulates a 25% tariff increase on US soybeans to China.
    *   Prints baseline flow details, market access analysis prior to shock, and then the adjusted volume, value, price, and remarks after the shock (e.g., significant volume drop, price increase for importer if not absorbed).
6.  **Complex Scenario (Wheat - Australia to Indonesia):**
    *   Simulates a multi-faceted scenario:
        *   Deterioration in India-MiddleEast relations (indirect impact).
        *   New SPS barrier on Australian wheat to Indonesia.
        *   Specific trade shock due to SPS compliance failure for an Aus-Indo wheat shipment.
        *   Improved customs under RCEP.
    *   Analyzes the primary flow (Aus-Indo wheat) through these events, printing the final adjusted volume and value.
    *   Analyzes an alternative market (Canada to Indonesia wheat), printing its baseline volume and landed cost.

## II. Value Chain Reconfiguration
